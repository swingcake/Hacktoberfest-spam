# Hacktoberfest-spam

This is most certainly a *rant* about how a lot of people misuse and degrade Hacktoberfest each year. Ridiculous amounts of spammy PRs, a lot of README edits and whatnot.  

I searched for something like this, but couldn't find anything. So, I created my own - this repo.

## Prevention

If you don't want to waste your time to make PR to a banned repository you should check out the issues of the chosen repository.

If you feel a little bit adventurous use the given basic GitHub search code below:

```text
author:"hacktoberfest-team" type:"issues" 
```

(A good PR would be a search query which returns all repositories with the label "hacktoberfest" whilst checking the issues from "hacktoberfest-team")

## Nice tip

If you are struggling to find a good project to contribute on, you can take a look at [Issuehub](http://issuehub.io). This page allows you to search for projects that have one or many specific labels you may feel more comfortable with.

## Major changes

Till last year, any pull request valid or invalid counted towards the completion of hacktoberfest challenge. But from this year *(2019)* onwards, a record is being kept to check whether the pull request is valid or not. Until validated by the maintainer, the pull request would not count towards the challenge completion.  
Detailed information can be found on the [official website](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details#spam).  

Let's work together to reduce spam.
